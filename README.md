# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Challenge Overview

This project was all about refactoring the starter code for this website in order to follow accessibility standards and increase search engine optimization.  We were given a User Story and specific Acceptance Criteria as a guide:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Actions Taken

### HTML
I adjusted indentations, renamed tags for semantic purposes, updated title, added meta elements for SEO, and corrected an inactive internal link.  

### CSS
Here I adjusted a background color to improve contrast ratio and consolidated selectors in order to provide a more easily navigable codebase.

### Github
Any changes made were regularly committed to the main branch of the associated GitHub repository.
